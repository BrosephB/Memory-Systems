# Memory Systems inspired by Harry Lorayne's teachings
In his book *How To Develop a Super Power Memory*, Harry Lorayne teaches about multiple systems of memory, such as the Peg system. To help me learn these systems and test myself on them easily every day, I made these small desktop applications using Python.

## Requirements
> Based on a pre-determined list of peg words, prompt the user to provide the correct peg word for each number or card. Then, provide feedback to the user on whether or not they were correct. Keep prompting the user until they get every answer correct and then tell the user that the program is complete

## What the Program does
1. Introduce the Program and start by asking for the peg word for any number (determined at random)
2. Determine if the user provided the correct peg word, and give feedback. If the user was correct, that number or card will no longer be asked for the duration of the program. If the user is incorrect, the program will ask about that same number or card at random at some other point of the duration of the program
3. Program continues until all numbers/cards have recieved a correct answer
4. After the last number/card is answered correctly, the program will end
